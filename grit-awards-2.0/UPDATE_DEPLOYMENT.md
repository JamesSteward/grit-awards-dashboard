## 🚀 Deploy to Existing grit-awards.vercel.app

### Authentication Required

The Vercel CLI requires browser-based authentication. Here's how to complete the deployment:

### **Step 1: Authenticate with Vercel**

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
cd /Users/jamesmorrisonsteward/Documents/GitHub/grit-awards-dashboard/grit-awards-dashboard/grit-awards-2.0

npx vercel login
```

**What happens**:
1. Terminal displays: `Visit https://vercel.com/oauth/device?user_code=XXXX-XXXX`
2. Press ENTER to open browser automatically, or copy URL manually
3. Browser opens to Vercel authentication page
4. Click "Confirm" to authorize the CLI
5. Terminal shows: `✔ Success! Logged in as <your-email>`

### **Step 2: Deploy to Production**

After authentication, run:

```bash
npx vercel --prod --yes
```

**Expected output**:
```
Vercel CLI 48.4.1
🔍 Inspect: https://vercel.com/...
✅ Production: https://grit-awards.vercel.app [copied to clipboard] [2m]
```

### **Alternative: Use Vercel Dashboard (Easier)**

If CLI authentication is problematic, use the Vercel Dashboard:

1. **Go to**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Find project**: `grit-awards`
3. **Click**: "Deployments" tab
4. **Click**: "Redeploy" button
5. **Select**: "Use existing Build" or trigger new build
6. **Confirm**: "Redeploy to Production"

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Vercel CLI authentication fails
**Solution**: Use Vercel Dashboard method instead:
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find `grit-awards` project
3. Click "Redeploy" on latest deployment

### Issue: Build fails on Vercel
**Solution**: 
- Check Vercel build logs in dashboard
- Verify Node.js version is 18+
- Confirm all dependencies in package.json

### Issue: Old version still showing after deploy
**Solution**:
1. Hard refresh browser: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check deployment URL in Vercel dashboard matches
4. Wait 1-2 minutes for CDN propagation

### Issue: Images not loading
**Solution**:
- Verify images exist in `/public` directory
- Check browser console for 404 errors
- Confirm image paths are absolute: `/image.webp`

### Issue: Animations not working
**Solution**:
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify framer-motion loaded correctly
- Test in incognito mode to rule out extensions
